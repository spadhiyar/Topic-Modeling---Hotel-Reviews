# Topic_Modeling-Hotel_Reviews

With a multitude of social feedback platforms available, such as Yelp or TripAdvisor, more and more customers turn to reviews before making their next decision on a hotel, restaurant, or a service. According to a TripAdvisor, Booking.com & Expedia study, 90% of travelers say reviews are influential when deciding where to stay.

To a business, customer reviews can contain loads of information that help to identify and fix existing issues, reward loyal customers, and win back dissatisfied ones. However, reading through hundreds of reviews is a tedious and time-consuming task. Instead, we can apply natural language processing to quickly summarize and sort reviews, delivering relevant information for appropriate departments to act on. Her we demonstrate how to build and utilize such a model on a dataset of reviews for a luxury hotel.
